					<p>Hi, I'm Jon. I'm a developer, electrical engineer, challenge seeker, opportunity finder, and soon to be a world changer.
					<br>
					<p> I was born and raised in NJ and am now a recent transplant in beautiful Miami Florida. I came here to pursue my true passion, programming. I coding 'bug' bit me back in highschool. I spent WAY too many math classes concentrating on writing fun apps on my Ti-83+ calculator. I went from making basic quadratic formula apps, to snake type games, to instant messaging apps and never had so much fun in class.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I orginally started college pursuing a Computer Engineering degree. I took a C++ course freshmen year and loved it. Next up was an accelerated Java I/II course. This is the course that made me think I couldn't make it as a programmer. The problem was that I was expected to alredy understand OOP before starting the class. I had never even heard of the OOP and thus became hopelessly lost right away. It was this Java course that lead me to switch to an Electrical Engineering degree. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>Fast forward several years of working as an Electrical Engineer and I wasn't happy. I knew what I wanted to do. I want to code. I worked on some side projects in my limited free time. I built a basic Android app and built a <a class ="textfield" href = "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tip-n-split/id926075288?mt=8">Tip Calculator</a> app for iOS. The coding 'bug' bit again. This time even stronger than before. I decided to trade in the stability of a good job that I didn't enjoy for the uncertainty of a brand new career. I left NJ, drove down to Miami, and started Wyncode Cohort 6! <a class = "textfield" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/revengeofthe6th">#Revengeofthe6th</a>
